Note:

I've done the assignment in a jupyter notebook this time ("HW2.ipynb").
The pdf file is just a copy of the jupyter notebook saved as a pdf via Latex, so you can just run the jupyter notebook instead.
(Installation instructions are here: https://jupyter.org/install )
If you don't want to run it, you can view the html version of the notebook ("HW2.html") in a browser instead of the pdf.
The tex files are also just the notebook saved as Tex.
